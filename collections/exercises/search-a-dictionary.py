## Set a variable called choice to the flavor you want to search for.

choice = input("Search for flavor:\n" )

## Use an if statement to check if choice is in the flavors dictionary.

## If it is, set another variable called cost to the value associated with choice.

## If it isnâ€™t, set cost to 0.

## Print the cost.

if choice in flavors:
    cost = flavors[choice]
else:
    cost = 0
print("The price of " + choice + " is " + str(cost) + ".")

### Search a Dictionary Part 2:

## Initialize two variables: highest_cost to 0 and fanciest to an empty string.

highest_cost = 0
fanciest = ''

## Loop through the flavors dictionary using a for loop.

## For each flavor, check if its price is higher than highest_cost.

## If it is, update fanciest to this flavor and highest_cost to its price.

## After the loop, print the most expensive flavor.

for i in flavors:
    if highest_cost < flavors[i]:
      highest_cost = flavors[i]
      fanciest = i
print("The fanciest flavor is " + fanciest)
